			<p>Americans are interactign with generative AI everyday, whether they realize it or not. Google searches generate AI summeries, algorithms use AI to serve up contents, many ads are genreated by AI. Despite the rising popularity of AI, polling shows that across the nation, people are concerned about the software. A complicated relationship between humans and machines is unfolding across all facets of daily life. </p>

			<p>According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/10/15/how-people-around-the-world-view-ai/" target="blank"> Pew Research</a>, 95% of people from coast to coast have heard a lot or a little about AI. Half of that same sample of US respondents said  they are more concerned than excited than excited about the rise of AI in daily life. Despite this concern, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/03/artificial-intelligence-in-daily-life-views-and-experiences/" target="blank">another study </a> shows that 30% of Americans interact with AI daily and the majority of those surveyed said that they interact with AI multiple times a week.</p>

			<p>In the face of their own concern people are introducing AI into many aspects of their lives. Interaction with AI is not always a conscious choice consumers make, but an accceptance that AI is always present. Google search generates an AI summary of the top links associated with any query. Social media videos are often edited and generated by machines. As businesses embrace the new technology, it can be difficult to escape it. </p>

			<p><a href="https://www.census.gov/hfp/btos/data_downloads" target="blank"> The Census Bureau’s Business Trends and Outlook Survey</a> shows that the percentage of businesses that are using AI to create goods and services increased by nearly seven points in the last two years ago. Consumers looking for answers about a product may have to speak with virtual agents, home decor has the potential to be covered in festive generated images. </p>

			<p>Using generative technology in any facet of life may seem like a harmless time saver, but the fear surrounding AI may be warranted. An MIT study found that the use of ChatGPT may be detrimental to brain health. When students were asked to write an essay using critical thinking, write an essay using ChatGPT, and not write an essay at all, the group generating their essays had the lowest recorded brain activity. I reached out to Ned Block, a Professor of Philosophy at NYU, and AI expert for comment about AI's affect on the mind, he has agreed to an interview, but has yet to comment at this time. </p>

			<p>In the 10 year moratorium on AI regulation, Americans will continue to build a relationship with online bots that may be difficult to untangle. The technology’s rise is popularity is destined to impact the lives of everyday people, but only time will tell what that impact entails. </p>
